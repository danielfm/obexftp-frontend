1. Downloading and running ObexFTP front-end
********************************************

If you downloaded the binary package, all you need to do is to extract the file
in some folder, set executable permissions to "obexftp-frontend" file and
run it.

For those who use a Debian-based system, there is a .deb package which you can
download from the project site. After installation, the package creates a GNOME
launcher under the Utility menu.

If you don't use GNOME, just run ObexFTP front-end using the following command
in your terminal window:

$ obexftp-frontend


2. What is this?
****************

The Open OBEX project, which is an open source project hosted in SourceForge.net,
is the most successful implementation of the OBEX (OBject EXchange) protocol for
Open Source Unix-based Operating Systems. Besides, it supports a wide range of
devices of different models and vendors.

The only bad thing about this great project is that the Open OBEX is a set of
command-line programs, and they are not so friendly to the end users. We have
been using the Open OBEX for some time, and we felt the need of a friendly user
interface to make things easier for us - the users.

So, ObexFTP front-end is a simple Java Swing application that uses ObexFTP under
the hood to make easier to manipulate the file system of OBEX-enabled devices.


3. Requirements
***************

This application is compiled in Java 6, and you must have the Java 6 Runtime
Environment correctly installed and configured in your system to in order to be
capable to run it. Check out the link below for more information:

http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp

The ObexFTP application is used by this front-end and it should be installed
as well. Check out the link below for more information:

4. Features
***********

The ObexFTP front-end project is still under development, but it already have a
bunch of useful features. For example, you can:

+ navigate through the device's files;
+ create folders in the device;
+ send files to the device;
+ download files to your computer;
+ delete files and folders;

7. Getting involved
*******************

In fact, there's a lot of work to be done in many different areas.

If you are a Java developer and have ideas and/or want to help us code this
application, contact us in the project's web site at SourceForge.net. Any help
is appreciated.


8. "Thank you" list
*******************

My first "thank you" is a huge one and it goes to the ObexFTP team. If ObexFTP
did not exists I would not have created ObexFTP front-end at all. So, thank you
ObexFTP team! :-)

Thanks to Substance developers and Tango Desktop Project artists for their

good-looking Swing application. :-)
